# Flights Dataset Exploration
## Alhassan Atama Isiaka


## Dataset

> Here, I looked at arrival delay of domestic flights in US in 1989. There are factors that cause Arrival delays based on th dataset. I looked at the relationship between it an departure delay with the distance to see how it affects this delay


## Summary of Findings

> The dataset has records of the year 1987 that has a lot of missing information however, I had been able to establish some factors that causes delay of flights. The data has numeric, categorical, data which are spread across several data types: int, string, Boolean, etc.
The data has some noise which we had to clean-up before analyzing. We removed NULLS, duplicates and blank values from the dataset to reduce the noise in the data



## Key Insights for Presentation

> <li>From findings, distance is a factor that affects the delay of Flights.  A larger distance affects delay of flights. It is logical to think that those travelling to a very far location are less compared to those trying to assess a less proximal area.</li>
<li>Weather would have  been another interesting trend to look at in the data but there had been Null values in the column so we had to remove it</li>
<li>It is correct to say that travelling in the evenings have more delay than in the mornings</li>
<li>The delay increases when end of the year is approached. This is logical because most people go on holidays within that period</li>
